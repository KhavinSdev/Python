Repo for housing of both finished and ongoing python projects(mostly source files at present)

Format: Name_v.v.v.py:

v.v.v refers to the version id, which is formatted as shown: MajorUpdate.SmallPatch.completeness - (completeness can be either 1 or 0 corresponding to completed and ongoing respectively)

For example: CbgOrLttc_1.2.1.py implies that the version of CbgOrLttc is after major update 1, contains patch sets up to and including 2, and it is a completed rollout of the version.

Individual source code files may have their own ReadMEs for specific information.

Enjoy :)
